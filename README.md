# mynetdiary
Process an edited csv file from the mynetdiary website to a graph via an excel spreadsheet.

The extent of the editing has yet to be determined.

The process as of 01/13/19 is as follows:
1) Pull an excel weekly summary down from the "my net diary" website.
2) Export a "csv" file from that excel spreadsheet.
3) Edit? that "csv" file (details later).
4) Run the perl script to produce a streamlined "csv" file (currently under development).
5) Import that "csv" file into the final spreadsheet to generate the chart which combines the following factors:
6) date, weight, cals, exercise, glucose, blood pressure
